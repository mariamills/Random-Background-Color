This random background color generator was initially simply a pretty straightforward project with little flair or responsiveness. It was merely a trial run project I undertook as I studied JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I've now expanded the project and added the ability to create gradient color backgrounds based on a selection. I intend to keep expanding and enhancing this project.
- Integrated a gradient background color generator
- Greatly improved appearance
##### Minor changes
- Updated readme & corrected typos
